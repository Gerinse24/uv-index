# uv-index
This is a small script for getting uv indexes meaning the weather. Works only for Australia at this moment. I'm sure anyone can easily edit the code for other countries.

# usage
Run from the command line using python uvindex.py state city. Use the acronym of your state ie: wa for Western Australia.
